## An analysis of short-term effects of migration inflows on unemployment rates across 38 OECD countries (1991â€“2020)
**Code**: 

**Objectives**: To determine whether migration inflows are associated with immediate changes in unemployment rates across 38 OECD countries. Namely, does a surge in immigration correlate with changes in unemployment rates a year later and five years later? Can migration inflows (outflows) be used to predict future unemployment rates?

**Skills**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, correlation matrix, regression models, ggplot2 visualizations

**Technology**: R language, RStudio, tidyverse package

**Result**: The results suggest a modest but statistically significant negative relationship between migration inflows and unemployment in the following year. On average, countries experiencing higher migration inflows tend to record slightly lower unemployment rates the next year. This effect diminishes over time but remains weakly negative five years later. The strength and direction of this relationship vary considerably between countries, emphasising the importance of national labour market structures and policies.
